Mac Install
=======================


This repo is made to ease the pain in setting up a new machine. A new machine only comes around once every few years, but there should be no pain in getting a new machine!
Speaking of, my current machine is getting pretty old...

It is probably only helpful to me. But it may be helpful to see how other people do it!

Todo List

* iTerm defaults
